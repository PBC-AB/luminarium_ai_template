# Luminarium Brand Styling Guide

This document outlines the visual and aesthetic guidelines for the Luminarium brand.

## Mood Board Description

The Luminarium mood board evokes a sense of antique celestial wonder and intricate, almost magical, craftsmanship. It features a collection of images that blend themes of astronomy, vintage mechanisms, and warm metallic textures.

Key elements visible in the mood board include:

* **Celestial Motifs:** A prominent, detailed illustration of a sun with a human-like face, reminiscent of historical astronomical drawings. Another image displays a sun-like emblem on a blue, star-dappled background, possibly part of an astrolabe or a similar navigational instrument.
* **Ornate Mechanical Devices:** Close-up shots of complex clockwork, gears, and an armillary sphere, highlighting precision engineering. These suggest a focus on intricacy, knowledge, and perhaps the passage of time or cosmic movements.
* **Textured Surfaces:** Images showcasing various metallic textures, including hammered copper, brushed gold, and aged brass. These textures add warmth, a sense of history, and a tactile quality to the brand's feel.
* **Color Palette Preview:** The mood board incorporates the brand's core colors, showing them in context and reinforcing the vintage, warm, and slightly mystical aesthetic. The name "LUMINARIUM" is also displayed in a classic serif font, harmonizing with the overall style.
* **Overall Aesthetic:** The general aesthetic is one of warmth, intellectual curiosity, and timeless elegance with a touch of the mystical and mechanical. It speaks to a brand that values history, knowledge, and detailed artistry, likely with a narrative rooted in discovery and illumination.

## Logo Description

The Luminarium logo is a stylized capital letter "L". The letter itself is a solid, aged brass, presented in a classic serif font that conveys a sense of tradition and stability.

Embedded within the structure of the "L" are several decorative celestial elements:

* Three stylized suns, each with radiating lines, are strategically placed along the vertical and horizontal strokes of the letter. These motifs are rendered in an ivory colour, contrasting with the brass, making them stand out against the darker background of the letter.
* Smaller, simpler four-pointed star shapes are interspersed between the sunbursts, further enhancing the celestial theme.

The logo is set against an ivory background. The overall design is elegant and clean, successfully integrating the brand's name initial with its core thematic elements of light and celestial bodies. It feels both classic and slightly mystical.

## Banner Descriptions

Two banner designs have been provided, both featuring a repeating pattern of celestial motifs:

* **Blue Banner** This banner uses a deep, midnight blue as its background color. The foreground elements, rendered in a contrasting gold, consist of stylized sunbursts (identical to those in the logo) and various star shapes (four-pointed and simpler sparkles). The pattern is dense and creates a rich, nocturnal sky effect, evoking a sense of wonder and cosmic expanse.

* **Ivory Banner** This banner utilizes a light ivory background. The celestial pattern is identical to the dark blue banner (stylized sunbursts and various star shapes), with gold contrasting to the ivory background. This version offers a lighter, more airy feel, while still maintaining the brand's core celestial theme. It feels warm, gentle, and subtly magical.

Both banners reinforce the brand's visual identity through consistent use of the sun and star motifs, differentiated primarily by their background colors and the resulting mood each evokes.

## Color Palette

The brand's color palette combines warm, earthy tones with a deep blue and a dark brown, creating a sense of sophistication, warmth, and grounding.

* **Aged Gold:** `#C29044` - A rich, warm gold, suggestive of antique metals and illumination.
* **Deep Blue:** `#25496C` - A classic, strong blue, reminiscent of the night sky or deep waters, adding a touch of seriousness and depth.
* **Dark Copper:** `#B36228` - An earthy, warm reddish-brown hue that exudes a sense of rustic charm and industrial elegance.
* **Ivory:** `#F3E7D5` - A soft, off-white, offering a neutral and elegant base or contrast.
* **Dark Brown/Almost Black:** `#24180A` - A very dark, rich brown that can appear almost black, providing strong contrast and a sense of solidity.

## Fonts

* **Headings:** Arvo
* **Body Text:** Libre Baskerville

These font choices, with Arvo's geometric slab-serif style for headings and Libre Baskerville's classic serif style for body text, complement the brand's blend of traditional elegance and structured design.
